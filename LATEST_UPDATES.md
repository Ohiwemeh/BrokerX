# Latest Updates - Oct 14, 2025

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Nodemon for Backend Development
**File:** `server/package.json`

Added dev script for easier development:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Now the server will automatically restart when you make changes to any file!

---

### 2. ✅ User Status Management
**Backend:** `server/routes/admin.routes.js`

- New users now show as **"Pending"** status by default (already in user model)
- Admin **cannot add funds** to unverified users
- Backend validation added:
  ```javascript
  if (user.accountStatus !== 'Verified') {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'User must be verified before adding funds' });
  }
  ```

**Frontend:** `client/src/admin/AdminPage.jsx`

- "Add Funds" button is **disabled** for unverified users
- Shows warning message: "⚠️ User must be verified before you can add funds"
- Button appears grayed out with `opacity-50` and `cursor-not-allowed`
- Alert shown if admin tries to click disabled button

**Workflow:**
1. User signs up → Status: **Pending**
2. Admin views user in admin panel → Sees "Pending" badge (orange)
3. Admin verifies user details → Clicks "Verify" button
4. User status changes to **Verified** (green badge)
5. Now admin can add funds to the user

---

### 3. ✅ Password Visibility Toggle
**Files Updated:**
- `client/src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx`
- `client/src/pages/Auth/Signup.jsx`

**Features:**
- Eye icon button next to password fields
- Click to toggle between showing/hiding password
- Uses `FaEye` and `FaEyeSlash` icons from react-icons
- Positioned absolutely on the right side of input
- Works for both password and confirm password fields

**Login Page:**
- Single password field with toggle

**Signup Page:**
- Password field with toggle
- Confirm password field with separate toggle
- Each can be toggled independently

---

6. Redirected to dashboard

### Admin Verification:
1. Admin logs in and goes to `/admin`
2. Sees new user in list with **orange "Pending"** badge
3. Clicks on user to view details
4. Reviews user information and uploaded ID documents
5. Sees warning: "⚠️ User must be verified before you can add funds"
6. "Add Funds" button is grayed out and disabled
7. Admin clicks **"Verify"** button
8. User status changes to **"Verified"** (green badge)
9. Warning disappears
10. "Add Funds" button becomes active (blue)
11. Admin can now add funds to user account

### Adding Funds (After Verification):

## Status Badge Colors

In Admin Panel:
- **Pending** → Orange badge (`bg-orange-500/10 text-orange-400`)
- **Verified** → Green badge (`bg-green-500/10 text-green-400`)
- **Rejected** → Red badge (`bg-red-500/10 text-red-400`)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Nodemon:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# Make a change to any file
# Server should automatically restart
```

### Test User Status Flow:
1. Create a new account via signup
2. Login as admin (manually set role to 'admin' in MongoDB)
3. Go to admin panel
4. Find the new user - should show "Pending"
5. Try to click "Add Funds" - should be disabled
6. Click "Verify" button
7. User status changes to "Verified"
8. "Add Funds" button becomes active
9. Click "Add Funds" and add money
10. Check user's dashboard - balance should update

### Test Password Toggle:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Type password
3. Click eye icon - password should become visible
4. Click again - password should hide
5. Go to `/signup`
6. Type password in both fields
7. Toggle each independently
8. Verify they work separately

---

## API Endpoints Affected

### POST `/api/admin/users/:id/add-funds`
**New Validation:**
- Checks if `user.accountStatus === 'Verified'`
- Returns 400 error if user is not verified
- Error message: "User must be verified before adding funds"

---

## Database Schema

User model already has:
```javascript
accountStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['Pending', 'Verified', 'Rejected'],
  default: 'Pending'
}
```

All new users automatically get `accountStatus: 'Pending'`

---

## Files Modified Summary

### Backend (2 files):
1. ✅ `server/package.json` - Added dev script
2. ✅ `server/routes/admin.routes.js` - Added verification check

### Frontend (3 files):
1. ✅ `client/src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx` - Added password toggle
2. ✅ `client/src/pages/Auth/Signup.jsx` - Added password toggles
3. ✅ `client/src/admin/AdminPage.jsx` - Disabled add funds for unverified users

---

## Security Improvements

1. **Backend Validation:** Server-side check prevents adding funds to unverified users even if frontend is bypassed
2. **Clear User Feedback:** Warning messages inform admin why action is disabled
3. **Password Visibility:** Users can verify they typed password correctly before submitting
