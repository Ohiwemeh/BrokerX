## Issue 1: Admin Page 403 Forbidden Error

### Problem:
- Admin page returns 403 error
- User doesn't have admin role in database

### Solution:
Created a script to make any user an admin.

**File Created:** `server/makeAdmin.js`

### How to Use:

1. **Find your email** (the one you signed up with)

2. **Run this command** in the server directory:
```bash
cd server
node makeAdmin.js your-email@example.com
```

**Example:**
```bash
node makeAdmin.js umokeuchenna2020@gmail.com
```

3. **Expected Output:**
```
Connected to MongoDB
✅ User "Your Name" (your-email@example.com) is now an admin!
User ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

4. **Logout and login again** to refresh your token

5. **Go to `/admin`** - should now work!

### Why This Happened:
- Backend requires `role: 'admin'` to access admin routes
- New users get `role: 'user'` by default
- This script updates the role in MongoDB

## Issue 2: Dashboard Shows User Profile

### Changes Made:
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

### Features Added:
1. **User Profile Header** at top of dashboard
   - Shows profile picture (if uploaded)
   - Shows user name: "Welcome back, [Name]!"
   - Shows user email
   - Fallback avatar icon if no picture

2. **"View Markets" Button**
   - Quick link to markets page
   - Blue button, top right

### What It Looks Like:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Avatar]  Welcome back, John Doe!    [View Markets] │
│            john@example.com                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Profile Picture:
- Automatically loads from user's uploaded profile image
- Shows default avatar icon if no image uploaded
- Circular with blue border
- 48x48 pixels

## Issue 3: Statistics Tab Routes to Markets

### Changes Made:
**File:** `client/src/router.jsx`

### What Was Done:
Added route mapping:
```javascript
<Route path="/statistics" element={<Markets />} />
```

### How It Works:
1. Click **"Statistics"** in sidebar
2. Routes to `/statistics`
3. Shows the **Markets page** (crypto & forex prices)
4. Sidebar highlights "Statistics" as active

### Why This Way:
- Statistics and Markets show the same data
- No need to duplicate the page
- Both routes point to same component
- User can access via either link

---

## Issue 4: Sign Out Button Now Works

### Changes Made:
**File:** `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`

### Features Added:
```javascript
const handleLogout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  navigate('/login');
};
```

### What Happens When You Click Sign Out:
1. ✅ Clears JWT token from localStorage
2. ✅ Clears user data from localStorage
3. ✅ Redirects to login page
4. ✅ User must login again to access app

### Security:
- Properly clears authentication
- No lingering session data
- Forces re-authentication

---

## Files Modified Summary

### Backend:
1. ✅ `server/makeAdmin.js` - NEW - Script to make users admin

### Frontend:
1. ✅ `client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Added user profile header
2. ✅ `client/src/router.jsx` - Added /statistics route
3. ✅ `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Added logout functionality

---

```

2. Go to `/admin`
3. Should see list of users

### Test 4: Statistics Tab
1. Click "Statistics" in sidebar

## Additional Notes

### Admin Access:
- Only users with `role: 'admin'` can access `/admin`
- Use the `makeAdmin.js` script to grant admin access
- Can make multiple users admin
- Admin users can still access all regular user features

### Profile Pictures:
- Upload in Settings → Profile tab
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG
- Automatically displays on dashboard
- Falls back to icon if not uploaded

### Statistics vs Markets:
- Both routes show same page
- "Statistics" is in sidebar
- "Markets" is direct route
- Both work identically

### Logout Security:
- Clears all authentication data
- Server-side token is stateless (JWT)
- No server cleanup needed
- User must re-authenticate
